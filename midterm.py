# TODO: Create a function to select a random word that:
# - Takes no parameters
# - Uses random.choice to select a random word from your word list
# - Returns the selected word in lowercase


# TODO: Create a function to initialize the game state that:
# - Takes parameter: word (str)
# - Creates and returns a dictionary with these keys:
#   - "word": the word to guess
#   - "guessed_letters": an empty list to track guessed letters
#   - "word_completion": a string of underscores representing unguessed letters (e.g., "_ _ _ _")
#   - "tries_remaining": number of incorrect guesses allowed (start with 6)


# TODO: Create a function to display the game state that:
# - Takes parameter: game_state (dict)
# - Prints the current hangman state based on tries_remaining
#   (You can use ASCII art for different hangman states)
# - Prints the current word completion (with spaces between letters)
# - Prints the letters that have been guessed so far
# - Prints the number of tries remaining
# ASCII art for hangman states

# TODO: Create a function to get a valid letter guess that:
# - Takes parameter: game_state (dict)
# - Asks the user to guess a letter
# - Validates that the input is:
#   - A single character
#   - A letter (not a number or symbol)
#   - Not already guessed
# - Returns the valid guessed letter in lowercase
# - Keeps asking until a valid letter is entered


# TODO: Create a function to update the game state that:
# - Takes parameters: game_state (dict) and guessed_letter (str)
# - Adds the guessed letter to the guessed_letters list
# - Checks if the guessed letter is in the word
# - If it is, updates the word_completion to reveal the letter
# - If it's not, decreases the tries_remaining
# - Returns True if the guess was correct, False otherwise


# TODO: Create a function to check if the game is over that:
# - Takes parameter: game_state (dict)
# - Returns True if the word is completely guessed or no tries remain
# - Returns False otherwise


# TODO: Create a function to check if the player won that:
# - Takes parameter: game_state (dict)
# - Returns True if the word_completion matches the word (no more underscores)
# - Returns False otherwise


# TODO: Create the main game function that:
# - Takes no parameters
# - Selects a random word
# - Initializes the game state
# - Displays welcome message and initial game state
# - Loops until the game is over:
#   - Gets a valid letter guess
#   - Updates the game state with the guess
#   - Displays the updated game state
# - When game ends, displays win or lose message
# - Reveals the word if the player lost
# - Asks if the player wants to play again

# - Prints a welcome message
# - Calls the main game function
# - Handles play again logic
